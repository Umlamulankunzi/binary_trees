# C - Binary Trees project in C Programming Language
_Why did the binary tree bring a ladder to the coding competition?_
_**Because it heard there would be lots of "branches" to climb!**__ ðŸ˜„

# Introduction
This repository contains solutions for tasks related to Binary Trees in C Programming Language. It covers the basic concepts of Binary Trees, the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree, the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists, the depth, the height, and the size of a binary tree, the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree, and what is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree. The tasks are based on common problems and algorithms related to binary trees, such as traversals, insertion, deletion, and searching.
